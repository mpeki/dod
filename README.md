# GitHub
[Issue Tracking](https://github.com/mpeki/dod/projects/1) and [Wiki](https://github.com/mpeki/dod/wiki).

# Build & Test
Gradle is building, verifying and publishing the project.

Building the project from the commandline: `gradle build` - this will also run tests. To run e.g. backend tests alone
execute: `gradle :backend:test`

Running test coverage locally: `gradle test jacocoTestCoverageVerification --info` and view the report [here](./backend/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html). 

## IntelliJ
When running tests via IntelliJ remember that the `test` profile should be active, this is achieved by setting the 
environment variable: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=test`  

## Docker
[Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) and the 
[Jib gradle plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin) is used to containerize 
the project app.

# Releases
See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Semantic Release
Currently using the [semantic-release project](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) to manage versions, 
since the project is being build with Gradle, the https://www.npmjs.com/package/gradle-semantic-release-plugin has been 
applied.

## Liquibase
To reset the initial schema creation yaml (01-create-schema.yaml) run: `gradle liquibaseDiffChangeLog`
